### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Be a full-stack application**
* **Consume and/or serve an API**
* **Have an interactive front-end**, preferably using a modern front-end framework
* **Be a complete product**, which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple models
* **Use a database**, whether that's one we've covered in class or one you want to learn
* **Implement thoughtful user stories** that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working API**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **working front-end**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with:
    * An embedded screenshot of the app
    * Explanations of the **technologies** used
    * A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
    * Link to your **user stories** – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
    * Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
* **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.** These are individual projects but you will likely incorporate code from another source. Imagine there is a style guide for writing your code--or better yet, write one!
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer would have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Q&A App
Think of how helpful sites like Quora & StackOverflow are. Maybe there's some other niche, or some surprising twist you can add to the question-and-answer game.

##### Car Repair Log
Keep up with your vehicle as you commute every day to your final weeks of WDI save things like mileage, last inspect, oil changes, and maybe even receipts & important document you need to have backed up.

##### Email-like Messages
Imagine a realtime messaging client, but with private messages, an inbox, unread messages, and who knows what else. This is your chance to re-invent email as we know it.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

The idea and tasks of this project will be approved by your peers, and then by an instructor.  You **must** have a target velocity that is the sum of all the story points in your task board.  

Your peers will let you know if you're biting off more than you can chew or if you can stretch harder.  

Then your instructor will **give you a clear number of points you must attain** in order to pass, based on what seems doable.  If at any point during project week you feel you will not be able to complete that number of points, it is **your responsibility** to inform an instructor as soon as possible, so that an alternative plan can be established.

There will be time on the morning after graduation to tweak your project and get above the line, but you should have a goal of **completing the target number of points by 2pm Wednesday 2/1**, and if you feel you cannot hit that deadline, it is **your responsibility** to inform an instructor as soon as possible.

* __Total__: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Project did not come close to velocity goal. Incomplete._
    **1** | _Project is close to velocity goal. Will need to use make-up time to pass. Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Velocity goal reached. Meets expectactions, good job!_
    **3** | _Velocity goal exceeded. Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

A 2 or a 3 will be a passing grade.  The instructors will not give specific feedback before graduation, so if you would like some code pointers, set up an appointment with Zeb before the Developer Showcase at 4pm on Thursday 2/9.

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
