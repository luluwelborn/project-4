### Tech Used

Javascript, jQuery and firebase.

### Approach

I started this app with react, but the learning curve was so great that I decided early on it was more realistic to use js to be able to deliver a complete final product. I started by reading firebase documentation and installing all the neccisary files. Next I worked on getting authentication up and running, and then hosting for user testing.

Next I built my main files, wrote scripts and did tests. I was able to get data on the front end, and the last main peice was to connect with the database. The final plan was to install bootstrap and css styles.

### Unsolved Problems / Major Hurdles

Friday I was getting errors when routing data to the database. Throughout the weekend I re-wrote scripts, read documentation, entered my own data in the database dashboard, worked with files structure, etc. I even created a second app to try and connect my firebase project locally.

I spoke with multiple people in class, compared code, and researched possible solutions ( for at leat 8 hours). I still have not found the solution to my issues.
